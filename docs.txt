This project is called Github Issue Tracker. 
The design is entirely based on Github (form, buttons, text, inputs, issues, message boxes, badges, everything).
It consists of 3 screen: 
    - Home screen with a search form and a paginated list of issues
    - Details screen for each selected issue
    - Bookmarks screen for the bookmarked issues
It is created with TypeScript and Expo.
It includes:
    - strict linting (configurations: react, react-native-community, google, prettier, a11y for accessibility )
    - theming (typography, colors and other things based on the design which makes styling a new component a breeze)
    - custom fonts (non-system) and svg support
    - SafeAreaView
    - testing with jest and react-test-renderer
    - react-navigation for navigating between screens (Deep Linking can be easily integrated as opposed to react-router-native)
    - AsyncStorage for storing bookmarked issues (you don't lose it when you quit the app, Redux is for rerendering)
    - Formik and yup for input validation

Start:
1. navigate to the root folder
2. 'npm install' in the Terminal

4. Start the app in the Terminal:
